# Difference between Fact and Dimension tables in SQL/Power BI with example.


### Quick Introduction
Fact and dimension tables are two fundamental concepts in data warehousing and database design. They serve different roles in organizing and storing data for efficient analysis. Here's the difference between them:

### Key Differences between Fact and Dimension Tables
**Fact Table:**
- A fact table contains the quantitative data or facts that you want to analyze.
- It typically consists of numerical values, measures, or metrics.
- Fact tables are often quite large, containing millions or even billions of records.
- They are associated with business transactions or events.
- Fact tables usually have foreign keys that link to dimension tables.
- They store data about what happened, such as sales, orders, or customer interactions.

**Dimension Table:**
- A dimension table contains descriptive attributes that provide context to the facts in the fact table.
- It holds textual or categorical data that helps in filtering, grouping, and labeling facts.
- Dimension tables are generally smaller compared to fact tables.
- They provide additional information for slicing and dicing the data.
- Dimension tables often have primary keys that are referenced as foreign keys in the fact table.
- They store data about who, what, where, when, and why something happened.


### Example - [HumanResource Schema]

Lets take an example of **HumanResource Schema** from AdventureWorks2022 Database. Here are the
tables and data from the HumanResources schema in
AdventureWorks2022 database:

* **Department:** This table contains information about the departments in the company, such as the department name, the department manager, and the department location.

| Column Name  | Data Type      | Description                                    |
|--------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| DepartmentID | int            | The unique identifier for the department.     |

| CountryRegion | nvarchar(20) | The country of the employee's address. |
| PostalCode | nvarchar(10) | The postal code of the employee's address. |

* **EmployeeDepartmentHistory:** This table contains information about the departments that employees have worked in, such as the department name, the department manager, and the department start and end dates.

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |

### So Let's Identify which are Fact and dimesnion Tables from the HumanResource Schema. 

So we have added prefix to whichever tables are Fact as Fact and Dimension ad Dim.

*fig. Data Model of HumanResource Schema*

The following tables in the HumanResources schema are fact tables:

* **EmployeePayHistory:** This table contains information about the pay history of employees.
* **EmployeeDepartmentHistory:** This table contains information about the departments that employees have worked in.

The following tables in the HumanResources schema are dimension tables:

* **Department:** This table contains information about the departments in the company.
* **Employee:** This table contains information about the employees of the company.
* **JobCandidate:** This table contains information about job candidates.
* **Shift:** This table contains information about the shifts that employees work.


### How tables were categorised as Fact and Dimesnion tables?
The **EmployeePayHistory** and **EmployeeDepartmentHistory** tables are fact tables because they store measurements of business events. The **EmployeePayHistory** table stores information about the pay of employees, such as their salary, bonus, and overtime pay. The **EmployeeDepartmentHistory** table stores information about the departments that employees have worked in, such as the department name, the department manager, and the department start and end dates.

The **Department**, **Employee**, **JobCandidate**, and **Shift** tables are dimension tables because they provide context for the measurements in the fact tables. The **Department** table provides information about the departments in the company, such as the department name, the department manager, and the department location. The **Employee** table provides information about the employees of the company, such as their name, address, and phone number. The **JobCandidate** table provides information about job candidates, such as their name, address, and resume. The **Shift** table provides information about the shifts that employees work, such as the shift start and end times, and the number of employees on each shift.
